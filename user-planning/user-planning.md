IMPORTANT BASELINE OF USER PLANNING
------------------------------------
- As a non-technical HR manager, I want to quickly see the skills and experience of a candidate, so that I can evaluate whether the candidate meets the requirements for an open position at my company.

- As a mid-level engineer, I want view a junior developer's project and read their code, so that I can evaluate their coding skills.

- As a friend of the person who built this portfolio, I want to see what my friend has built so that I have an understanding of what they do as a developer and I can encourage them.

- I want to be able to find and navigate through what I am looking for, this will gives me a full understanding of why I am here and    prevent me from feeling lost

- I want to be able to transition smoothly from one link to another without having any problems with transitional lag

- I want to be able to contact the person who I am visiting, if he/she is relevant to me I would like to be able to do so.

-To be able to contact me by making a contact me link and a placement for the visitor to leave his/her name and email
