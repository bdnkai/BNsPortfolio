Welcome!<br />
This portfolio page was made by me for an all-in-one easy navigation. A minimalist theme where visitors gets to know me without feeling lost or having to click everything.<br />

## Thoughts Before Creation / User-Planning:

### As a visitor:

- I want to be able to read the text clearly, so that I don't miss anything that could be important

- I want to be able to find and navigate through what I am looking for. This'll give me a full
  understanding of why I am here and prevent me from feeling lost

- I want to be able to transition smoothly from one link to another without having any problems with transitional lag

- I want to be able to contact the person who I am visiting, if he/she is relevant to me I would like to be able to do so.

<br />

### As a developer of the website, I want my visitors:

- To be able to read the text clearly by making sure my fonts colors and background do not collide.

- To be able to navigate through my website without any problems; to prevent this; I should not force my visitors to go to one page to get to a specific page that they may be looking for.

- To be able to contact me by making a contact me link and a placement for the visitors to leave his/her name and email
