## Behind The Scene Thought Process Before Creation 
---------------
As a visitor...
---------------
- I want to be able to read the text clearly, so that I don't miss anything that could be important

- I want to be able to find and navigate through what I am looking for. This'll give me a full understanding of why I am here and prevent me from feeling lost

- I want to be able to transition smoothly from one link to another without having any problems with transitional lag

- I want to be able to contact the person who I am visiting, if he/she is relevant to me I would like to be able to do so.

-----------------------------------------------------
As a developer of the website, I want my visitors...
-----------------------------------------------------
- To be able to read the text clearly by making sure my fonts colors and background do not collide.

- To be able to navigate through my website without any problems; to prevent this; I should not force my visitors to go to one page to get to a specific page that they may be looking for.

- To be able to contact me by making a contact me link and a placement for the visitors to leave his/her name and email
